# This is a template for your development Dockerfile
# You should modify this to suit your specific React application needs

# Use Node.js LTS Alpine for a smaller image size
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files for dependency installation
# Adjust for your package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm)
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies
# Change this if you use a different package manager
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
# Note: When using docker-compose, we'll override this with a volume mount
COPY . .

# Expose the port Vite uses (default is 5173)
EXPOSE 5173

# Start the development server with host set to 0.0.0.0
# This allows connections from outside the container
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev", "--", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]

# NOTE: For hot reload to work properly, you'll need to:
# 1. Use docker-compose to mount your source code as a volume
# 2. Ensure Vite is configured to watch for changes
# 3. Ensure your host machine's port is mapped to the container port
